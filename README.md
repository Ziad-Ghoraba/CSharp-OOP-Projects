## ðŸ“Œ Topics Covered
This repository demonstrates several key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and software development principles, including:

- **Encapsulation:** Protecting data using classes, private fields, and access modifiers.
- **Inheritance:** Creating specialized classes from base classes to promote code reusability.
- **Polymorphism:** Implementing interfaces and method overriding to provide flexible functionality.
- **Interfaces & Abstraction:** Defining contracts for class behavior to enforce consistency.
- **File Handling:** Reading and analyzing files in different formats (`.txt`, `.csv`).
- **Data Structures & Algorithms:** Implementing efficient data handling techniques in projects.
- **Software Design:** Using UML diagrams and structured design methodologies.

## ðŸŽ“ Learning Journey
This repository is a result of my continuous learning in **.NET development and Object-Oriented Programming**.  
Throughout my journey, I have built various projects to strengthen my understanding of **C#**, OOP principles, and software architecture. These projects were developed based on academic learning, self-study, and hands-on experience while working on real-world applications.

By implementing these projects, I have gained:
- **Practical experience in C# and the .NET ecosystem.**
- **A deep understanding of OOP principles and their application.**
- **Experience in designing and structuring maintainable, scalable code.**
- **Hands-on experience in working with files, user interactions, and system modeling.**

This repository serves as both a learning resource and a showcase of my journey in software development. I continuously seek to improve my skills and apply best practices in software engineering.
